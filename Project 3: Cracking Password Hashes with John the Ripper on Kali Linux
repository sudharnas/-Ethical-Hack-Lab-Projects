Introduction

This advanced project focuses on systematic password hash analysis using John the Ripper. It demonstrates multiple cracking modes, including wordlists, rules, and incremental attacks, to assess password strength in an ethical penetration testing context.

Pre-requisites

Knowledge of hashing algorithms

Familiarity with Linux CLI

Understanding of password security principles

Tools

Kali Linux

John the Ripper

Custom and default wordlists

Sample shadow/password hash files

Installation

Ensure John the Ripper is installed:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install john

Tasks
Task 1: Basic Hash Cracking
john passwords.txt

Task 2: Custom Wordlist Attack

Create a wordlist:

echo -e "password\n123456\nadmin\nqwerty" > wordlist.txt


Run John with wordlist:

john --wordlist=wordlist.txt passwords.txt

Task 3: Shadow File Hash Cracking

Combine passwd and shadow files (authorized lab only):

unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > shadow_hashes.txt


Crack hashes:

john shadow_hashes.txt

Task 4: Incremental (Brute-Force) Mode
john --incremental passwords.txt

Task 5: Rules-Based Cracking
john --rules passwords.txt

Task 6: Analyzing Results

Display cracked passwords:

john --show passwords.txt


Analyze patterns such as:

Common words

Short passwords

Reused credentials

Learning Outcomes

Practical password auditing skills

Understanding of cracking techniques

Awareness of password policy weaknesses

Ethical use of security tools

Ethical Notice

All cracking activities must be conducted only on authorized systems and test data. Unauthorized password cracking is illegal and unethical.
