Introduction

This project introduces honeypots using Cowrie, a popular SSH and Telnet honeypot. Honeypots are used to safely observe attacker behavior without risking real systems. In this project, you will deploy Cowrie, simulate attacks, and analyze captured logs.

Pre-requisites

Basic knowledge of SSH and Telnet

Familiarity with Linux terminal commands

Understanding of basic network security concepts

Tools

Kali Linux – Penetration testing OS

Cowrie – SSH/Telnet honeypot

Docker – Container platform

Installation
Step 1: Install Docker
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

Step 2: Pull Cowrie Image
sudo docker pull cowrie/cowrie

Step 3: Run Cowrie Honeypot
sudo docker run -d -p 2222:2222 -p 2223:2223 --name cowrie cowrie/cowrie


Cowrie will now listen on:

SSH: Port 2222

Telnet: Port 2223

Tasks
Task 1: Verify Honeypot Status
sudo docker ps


Expected Output: Cowrie container running.

Task 2: Simulate an Attack
ssh root@localhost -p 2222


Enter any password.

Expected Output: Fake shell access is granted and logged.

Task 3: View Honeypot Logs
sudo docker logs cowrie


Expected Output: Login attempts and commands appear in logs.

Task 4: Analyze Cowrie Logs
sudo docker exec -it cowrie /bin/bash
cd /srv/cowrie/var/log/cowrie
cat cowrie.json


Expected Output: JSON‑formatted attack data.

Task 5: Basic Log Awareness (Optional)

Identify:

Common usernames

Password attempts

Commands used by attackers

Learning Outcomes

Understanding honeypot concepts

Deploying Cowrie using Docker

Monitoring attacker behavior

Analyzing security logs

Ethical Notice

This project must only be performed in authorized lab environments. Honeypots are for learning and research purposes only.
