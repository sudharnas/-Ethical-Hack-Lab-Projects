Overview

This advanced project focuses on deep network reconnaissance and enumeration using Nmap on Windows. The objective is to collect detailed intelligence about hosts, open ports, services, operating systems, firewall behavior, and potential security weaknesses within an authorized network. This project is designed for learners with prior knowledge of basic scanning who want to perform optimized, stealth-aware, and in-depth network analysis on Windows systems.

Advanced Lab Requirements

Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit recommended)

Nmap for Windows installed

Command Prompt or PowerShell

Administrator privileges (required for advanced scans)

Authorized local or lab network

Basic understanding of TCP/IP, ports, and firewalls

Tool Setup (Windows)
Install Nmap

Download Nmap from the official website

Install with Npcap (required for advanced scans)

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator

Verify installation:

nmap --version

Advanced Tasks
1. Host Discovery Without Port Scanning

Identify live hosts without scanning ports:

nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

2. Stealth SYN Scan

Perform a stealth TCP SYN scan (Admin required):

nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24

3. Full TCP Port Scan

Scan all 65,535 TCP ports on a target:

nmap -p- 192.168.1.10

4. UDP Service Enumeration

Enumerate UDP services:

nmap -sU 192.168.1.10

5. Service & Version Enumeration

Detect detailed service and version information:

nmap -sV --version-intensity 9 192.168.1.10

6. Operating System Fingerprinting

Perform OS detection:

nmap -O --osscan-guess 192.168.1.10

7. Firewall & IDS Detection

Analyze firewall filtering behavior:

nmap -sA 192.168.1.10

8. Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

Run vulnerability detection scripts:

nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.10

9. IDS Evasion Techniques

Use slow timing and packet fragmentation:

nmap -T2 -f 192.168.1.10

10. Output & Reporting

Save results for documentation and reporting:

nmap -A 192.168.1.10 -oA advanced_scan_report


This generates:

advanced_scan_report.nmap

advanced_scan_report.xml

advanced_scan_report.gnmap

Learning Outcomes

Advanced host and service enumeration on Windows

Firewall and IDS behavior analysis

Vulnerability discovery using NSE

Stealth-aware scanning techniques

Professional penetration testing documentation

Ethical Notice

All scans must be conducted only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized network scanning is illegal and unethical.
